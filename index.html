<h1 align="center"> GITHUB INTRODUCTION</h1>
<div class="code">
<table>
<ol>
<li>The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett,
Tom Preston-Werner and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008.</li>
<li>In 2010, GitHub announced that it was hosting 1 million repositories. A year later, this number doubled.</li>
<li>In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan that is its first office outside of the U.S.
 Five years later, GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited.</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="center" > GITHUB COMMANDS</h1>
<div class="dia1">

<li style="font-size:20px; ">INIT</li>
<p>To create a local git repository for us in our store folder.This will help to manage the git commands for that particular repository.</p>
<li style="font-size:20px; ">STATUS</li>
<p>To see whats changed since last commit.It shows all the files that have been added and modified and ready to be commmitted and files which are untracked</p>

<h3 align="center" > VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</h1>
<div class="dia2">
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled,
 though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.</p>
<h4 aling="left" >TYPES OF VERSION CONTROL</h4>
<ol>
<li style="font-size:15px; "> LOCAL VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</li>
<p>Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever).
 This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone.
 It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to</p>
<li style="font-size:15px; ">CENTRALIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM</li>
<p>The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems.
 To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, 
Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files,
 and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.</p>
